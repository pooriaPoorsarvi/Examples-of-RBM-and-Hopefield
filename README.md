# Examples-of-RBM-and-Hopefield
in this example we will be using hopefield neural networks to remember simple patterns. you can click on the blue circles to make them green and change their state from 0 to 1. the hopefield network is a kind of neural network. it acts like a memory and it likes to have a low energy and it finds that low energy with the things that it has already seen. you can change the size of the gird by chainging mx and my in my code :D <br>
download the codes with the images so it'll work properly.
